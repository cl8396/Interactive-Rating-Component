What heading level selector to use? As it is a standalone component out of the context of a webpage
Do I place a single h1 on the rating state and not the thank you state? Perhaps a h2 on both headers is suitable.

I am going to use data attributes of (data-active="false" and data-active="true") to toggle the contents of 
the rating card.

Am I naming things correctly (using BEMM as a general guide). Particularly in the 'thank you state'.

Is there a better way of creating the required spacing between elements? Tried using flex but that still does not allow you 
complete control over the spacing without writing more CSS.

.flow utility class seems to do the job

I used hidden radio buttons to allow only one rating 'option' to be selected at once. I styled a related 'label' element to visually 
represent buttons. Is there a better way?

Responsivness. My media rule seems very clunky and inelegant. Better way?
