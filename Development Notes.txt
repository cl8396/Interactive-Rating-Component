What heading level selector to use? As it is a standalone component out of the context of a webpage
Do I place a single h1 on the rating state and not the thank you state? Perhaps a h2 on both headers is suitable.

I am going to use data attributes of (data-active="false" and data-active="true") to toggle the contents of 
the rating card.
